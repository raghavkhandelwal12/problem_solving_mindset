# Task 4 : **Detailed Exploration of Strings**

- **Objective** : `Strings maniputlation,concatenation,slicing,formatting(f-string format())` learn.

**Practice**
```
college_problems=input("enter the College related problem: " )
print(college_problems)

print(college_problems.upper()) # print the string in the upper case
print(college_problems.lower()) #print the strings in the lower case
print(college_problems.split()) # split the problem

```

```
a="hello world"
print(a[0:4]) # this is a string slicng technique and give the range of the characters.
```

```
a="hello "
b="world "
print(a + b) # this is the string concatenation
```

```
name = "raghav khandelwal"
age=20
print(f"my name is {name} and {age} year old") # this is f strings.
```
## Outcome

- I learn about the strings in the details what is string. String is nothing but enclosed the character into `single(') and double codes(" ")`.
- I learn how to slicing technique is used we can access the element in this technique .
- After i learn about the string method like `.upper(), lower(), split.`
- I learn about the string `concatenation and f-string`.
