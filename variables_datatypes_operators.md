# Task 3 : **Variables, & Basic Data Types (Number & Strings)**

- **Objective** : What is `variable`, and what is the `data types`(integer,float, and strings).

- Variable is used to allocate the memory and it is like a container.

```
# in this the college_problem is variable and the = is operator and value in the multiline string format

college_problem='''In India, many colleges prioritize financial gains and academic performance metrics over genuine learning, leading to graduates being underprepared
for the job market.'''
print(college_problem)
```

```
# Number with arithmetic operation
a=int(input("enter the number"))
b=int(input("enter the second number"))
print(a+b) # this add the a and b
print(a-b) # this minus the a and b
print(a*b) # this multiply a and b
print(a/b) # this a divide b
print(a//b) # this give the complete division in this like 3//2 it give the 1
print(a**b) # this is power 

```


## Learning Outcome

- `Variable` : After the learning out the variable i know what is variable. Variable is nothing but it is container to allocate the memory.

- To define the variable We follow some rule and some its types which is really necessary in out programming.

- `There are some types of case to define the multi variable name`.

1. `camelCase` : In camel_Case the first letter of the variable is small and other variable first letter is capital.

```
your_Name="abc" (The your_Name is camel case)

```

2. `PascalCase` :  In Pascal_Case the first letter of the each variable is capital.

```
Your_Name = "xyz" (here Your_Name is Pascal case)

```

3. `snake_case` : In this each variable is seperated by `underscore(_) `.

```
your_nam="xyz" (here your_name is snake_case)

```

- **Operators** :  There are many operators to compute the calculations. I learn about more operators.

1. Arithmetic Operator `(+,-,*,**,//,%)`
2. Assighment operator `(=,+=,-=,%=,/=)`
3. Logical Operator    `(and,or,not)`
4. Comparison Operator `(>,>=,<=,!=)`
5. Bitwise Operator    `(&&,^,>>,<<)
6. Membership Operator `(in or in not)`
7. Identity Operator   `(is or is not)`

- **Data Types** : I learn about the data types there are many data types in python.

- Numbers `(int,float,complex)`
- `list`
- `dict`
- `set`
- `bool`

- I learn about mutable and immutable concept which owns pros and cons.
