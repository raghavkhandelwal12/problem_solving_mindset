# Task 2
## Python Basics Syntax

- **Objective** : Basic `syntax`, `indentation`, and `comments (single-line # aur multi-line ''' ... ''')` to understand.



- Identation refer to the space at the begining of the line

  ```
  # This is the my single line comment(Use `#` to denote the single line comment)
  ```

```
print("This refer to (#) syntax of the single line comment") # this print the statement.
```

```
    # print("this provide an error so avoid this because it is not follow the proper indentation")

```
## Types of comments.

1. `Single line comments(#)`
2. `Multiline comment(''' ''')`

- `Comments` is not `execute` but it make the `code is more readable that is easily understand by everone`.
- After i read how to `print` the statement using the print function.

#### **Learning Outcome** : 

- After the learning about the `indentation` i know `identation` is very important.
- in python without indentation the code give the error which is mention in the above.
- After this i learn about the comment in python there are two types of comments `single line and multiline.`
- After i learn about how to print the statement using the `print()` function. This refer to the output of the code.
